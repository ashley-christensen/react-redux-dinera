Languages/Libraries/Tools:
--React, ReactStrap, React Router, Formik, React Spring, Node, and Redux/Redux Toolkit for State Management

Challenges: 
--Learning to implement Redux Thunk for asynchronous Redux.
--Learning and implementing Selector functions and Slices/ as well as organizing files for Redux State management
--Post functionality to add a new comment to the Dines Detail/server.
--Formik can be a useful Library and takes out heavy-lifting for user forms.

Learning:
--This project helped me learn the differences between the Flux design pattern and MVC, particularly Fluxâ€™s uni-directional data flow. Redux can be an organized and scalable way to manage state. Its strengths include scalability, modularity and the ability to manage state within one store and within one area. Redux produces downsides in its verbose boilerplate and sometimes difficult readability. 
--Additionally, Redux Thunk was incredibly useful and dynamic for AJAX operations inside Redux slices. Organization and modularity are incredibly helpful when building upon a codebase.
